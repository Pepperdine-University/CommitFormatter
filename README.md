# Commit Formatter

Commit Formatter extends team explorer and adds automatic word wrap to the Git commit message textbox according to the [50/72 style][0]. A counter let's you keep track of the number of characters left on the current row. Text width, monospaced font and font size can be configured under Git Settings.

The extension only works on Visual Studio 2013 (not 2015 yet).
